The link_to method is a helper method that generates an HTML link. The first argument is the text that will be displayed on the link, and the second argument is the path that the link will point to. In this case, the path is /auth/twitter . This is the path that we defined in the routes.rb file.

The link_to method will generate the following HTML:

<%= link_to "Sign in with Twitter", "/auth/twitter" %>
